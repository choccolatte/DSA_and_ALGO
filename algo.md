## algorithm
- a set of steps a program takes to finish a task. 
- understanding when to apply a certain algo  requires properly understanding the problem at hand.
- if you have a problem, an algorithm is a set of steps that solves that problem. 

## algorithmic thinking - 
- quickly establish the bounds/rules of the problem when you are stuck/asked a problem. No solution works on every problem. 
- So, an important part of algorithmic thinking is, to clearly define what the problem set is, and clarify what values count as inputs.  
- there is no best solution to a problem. What you should focus on is to figure out what solution would be the best for the problem at hand. 
- when you encounter a problem, before rushing in and thinking of a solution, what you want to do is work through the guidelines. What you want to do is break down the problem into any possible number of smaller problems where each problem can be clearly defined in terms of input and output. 

## Guidelines for an algorithm - 
- Clearly defined Problem Statement, input and output. 
- The steps in the algorithm must be in a very specific order, it should have a specific set of instructions in a particular order.
- each guideline/rule shouldnt be complex, it should be explicitly clear - the steps also need to be distinct.
- algorithm should produce a result.
- algorithm should actually complete and not take an infinite amount of time - it should complete in a finite amount of time. 

## Time Complexity & Space Complexity - 
- time complexity basically means the time it takes for an algo to finish a task. Best case - 1, worst case - n.
- space complexity means the space it takes for the algo on RAM (or the space it occupies) to run and complete its task. The best case here would be for an algo to take as less of space as possible to complete its task so that other running programs dont get hampered. 


## Linear Search - 
- takes as much time as there are elements to go over - n-times.
	- best case runtime - 1
	- avg case runtime - n/2
	- worst case runtime - n
